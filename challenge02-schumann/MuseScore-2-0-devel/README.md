#### Journal

On examining the source, it looks mostly straightforward.  Aside from layout details, there are only two aspects that will need special intervention just to notate: the incomplete voice notation used through in the LH (two voices, but only one shows all three beats) and the similar notation in the RH in the third bar from the end (made trickier by the combination of two voices onto one stem).  Everything else should be completely straightforward.
