Challenge 2 - Schumann: Carnaval
-----------------------------

As the first found challenge seemed too complex for a first task I decided
to provide a second assignment which is considerably more mainstream.
But I did *not* want to go even further and start with a trivial score.

*Estrella* from Robert Schumann's
[*Carnaval op. 9*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnaval_(Schumann) (you have to add a closing
parenthesis to the link manually)
seems a good compromise: it is short enough to be engraved as a whole piece,
it does *not* pose real engraving difficulties but *still* has some basic challenges
built-in, such as polyphonic settings and a rather large number of articulations.

So now you're ready to take off!

The base branch you should base any work on is `2-schumann-challenge`.

As this is the first (real) challenge the ["General Rules"](../meta/general-rules.md) aren't really refined
or tested yet. So please don't start hacking away but rather try to check back with someone
else before.

Please remember: This is a challenge and only partly a contest. It is not the goal to finish
the assignment as fast as possible, it's not even mandatory to actually *finish* it -
you may also concentrate on a single staff or even measure. The point is trying to get the
most perfect end-result and to create a retraceable, well-documented progress on your way
there.
